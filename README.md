# zookeeper-python-developer
This short code challenge can help the local zoo look after its denizens. You will create a tool for monitoring animals and their status.
This challenge is taken from [JetBrains/Hyperskill's](https://hyperskill.org) Python Developer study plan.

## Description
There are many animals in the zoo: all of them need care, and some of them are endangered and require preservation efforts. Animals must be fed, cleaned, surrounded by their kin, and kept happy. That is a difficult task for such a big open-range zoo, so one of your employers suggested a better way to accomplish that. She wants to be able to watch any animal on the screen with the help of a special program.
In this project, you will create a program that helps the zookeeper check on the animals and see that they're well. Your product will be able to understand commands from the zoo staff and show the animals on the monitor.

## Learning outcomes
This project is aimed at our beginners. It helps you understand some syntax basics and learn how to work with variables, data storage types such as lists, and while loops.
